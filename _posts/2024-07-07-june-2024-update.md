# June 2024 Update
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NatickGames/natickgames.github.io/main/assets/05-24-Update/CharacterCallingsBanner.png" alt="Character Classes">

Hey internet people! Last month’s update was on the technical side, talking about how I’m automating testing for Valantis. This month I wanted to shift gears and talk more on the gameplay side. So let’s talk about character callings! 

## Finding Your Callings

Callings are the term I’m using for player “classes” in the game. All characters are dual class builds, so I’ve taken to describing them as callings rather than classes, as they really more represent affinities your character has, rather than a rigid class for them. Each calling thematically and mechanically covers a subset of what you’d expect from a typical RPG class, allowing you to compose characters that fit the fantasy you want to roleplay as, without giving you one specific rogue or wizard class. If you wanted to play a Wizard type character, for example; you won’t find a “Wizard” calling, but you will find various elemental callings you can pick from, as well as some tied to mental magic like the Mentalist, or the scholarly tendencies of wizard characters like the Codex calling. This lends some player expression to exactly the type of “wizard” you create, and allows for more replay value, as you can play the same archetype of character but try out different callings and combinations to create different playstyles.


<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NatickGames/natickgames.github.io/main/assets/05-24-Update/CallingsCategories.png" alt="Character Callings by Category">

At launch, I hope to have 16 callings available in the game. 8 of them have been implemented so far. They’re split into four categories of four callings each: Body, Mind, Spirit, and Elemental. 6 will be unlocked and available when you first launch the game, and the other 10 will be unlocked through questlines that take you into the fantasy and the story of those specific callings. I don’t want to spoil too much about the unlockable classes this early in development, but here are the names of all of the callings by category. Bolded names are the default classes unlocked when you first start the game, the rest need to be unlocked.

| Body | Mind | Spirit | Elemental |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bulwark | Dreadspeaker | Warden | Flameshaper |
| Deadeye | Lifeshaper | Commander | Breathseeker |
| Duelist | Mentalist | Siren | Aquasense |
| Assassin | Codex | Diplomat | Stoneworker |

I have more calling ideas squirreled away in case the game does well and I’m able to justify post-launch content, but I’ve put a lot of thought and design-work into ensuring that these 16 classes cover the vast majority of common or popular fantasy RPG classes, with at least a few possible combos for variation. These callings are by far one of the top things I’m excited about seeing players get their hands on when Valantis is complete.

## What Makes a Character?

So what are you choosing between when you choose your callings?

Each character in Valantis has 5 active abilities, which are split up between a right hand weapon ability, a left hand weapon ability, two special abilities chosen from the pool of their calling abilities, and 1 signature ability chosen between their two callings. Each calling has 2 special abilities and 1 signature ability, meaning you can only take half the abilities your callings make available to you. A character with the same weapons and same callings may still have completely different calling abilities.

In addition to this, each class has 2 unlockable passive abilities, which are active depending on which of your callings you set as your “Passion” (your primary calling), and which one is your “Gift” (your secondary calling. Because of this, you can not equip both passives from a single calling on one character; you always have one passive from each of your callings. I’ve talked about the Passion and Gift passives before, in [this update](https://natickgames.github.io/2024/04/06/march-2024-update.html).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NatickGames/natickgames.github.io/main/assets/05-24-Update/CharacterBuild.png" alt="Character Build">

I’ll do a separate update to talk about the stats and action points systems in the game, but for this article, it should be enough to know that there are three types of damage and defenses in the game, Physical, Magical, and Condition. Your stats will determine your efficacy and defense against each of these types of damage, and another set of stats controls your action points (think mana) that are available to you each turn. These are broken into categories as well, and each ability will require a different combination of action points to cast. There are Offensive, Utility, Defensive, and General AP. General serves as a wildcard, but also is required specifically for signature abilities.

The callings are designed so that some of them specialize in one type of damage, but others can play towards multiple damage types depending on your stats. We’ll see that soon with one of the classes we’ll look at.

With weapons, calling abilities, action points, and calling passives, you can see that there are a lot of ways to differentiate one character build from another. For the rest of this update, I want to show off 3 of the 6 starter classes, and show how they can be combined in different ways to create very different playstyles. So lets look at the Deadeye, the Flameshaper, and the Warden.

## Deadeye - So You Like Knives?

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NatickGames/natickgames.github.io/main/assets/05-24-Update/Deadeye.png" alt="Deadeye Calling">

The deadeye is the ultimate target weapons specialist, and their abilities focus on ranged, multi-target damage. 

Their first ability is **Triple Throw** which allows them to throw a dagger at up to three different targets. They can throw all three at the same target, spread them among three different targets, or some other combo. Each target takes physical damage, and gains the bleeding effect if the condition hits.

Their second ability is **Fan of Knives**, which launches knives out in every direction around them, hitting any characters, friend or foe, that are in range. The targets take physical damage, and gain poisoned.

Finally, their Signature is **Heartseeker**. The deadeye’s precision aim finds it’s mark and the target character loses HP equal to 25% of their max health. If they kill the target with Heartseeker, they can use it again for free this turn. Chaining Heartseeker kills one after another as a Deadeye is incredibly satisfying if you line it up right.

For the Deadeye’s passives, their Passion passive gives the Deadeye a damage bonus for each tile of distance between them and their target. Any class with long range abilities, or weapons like the bow, would love to benefit from this.

Their Gift makes it so that none of the Deadeye’s combat AoE abilities (like Fan of Knives) hit allies. Neutral characters still need to be worried, however.

We’ll get to building some combos with the Deadeye calling, but to do so we need to have something to combo them with. A particularly fun combination is with the Flameshaper.

## Flameshaper - Burninating the Peasants

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NatickGames/natickgames.github.io/main/assets/05-24-Update/Flameshaper.png" alt="Flameshaper Calling">

The Flameshaper is your go-to for Ranged, AoE Magical damage. They have a minor focus on crowd control through area denial, mostly by threatening a large area with their ranged attacks, but also through their signature ability, **Firewall.**

Flameshapers’ first ability is a classic, **Fireball**. This is what it sounds like. You summon a flaming meteor-type fireball down from the sky and hit an area with magical damage at range. This is just pure damage. It’s expensive, but if you can build your action points correctly, you can dish out a LOT of damage in one turn at range.

Their second ability is the gap closer, **Flame Dash**. The Flameshaper lights themselves aflame and dashes through tiles in a straight line. Dealing minor damage to characters along their path, and significant damage to characters on the tile they land on.

Finally, their signature, **Firewall**, engulfs a large area around the Flameshaper in flame. The fire effect lingers on tiles for a few turns, and deals damage to any character starting their turn in it, or walking through it.

The Flameshaper’s passives play into the fire tile effect from their signature. Their Passion makes it so that any AoE ability cast by the Flameshaper will light tiles on fire for one turn. This adds lingering fire to Fireball targets and to the Flame Dash path, but it would also, for instance, leave fire behind on all tiles that a Flameshaper/Deadeye would hit with their Fan of Knives.

That fire is dangerous, however, even to the Flameshaper. Their Gift goes the defensive route, making all allies, including the Flameshaper themself, immune to fire tile damage from any source. If you play Co-op, and take two Flameshapers in your party, you could build around one Flameshaper lighting as many tiles on Fire as possible while the other ensures your party is immune. Just watch out for neutral NPCs…

## Warden - Kevin McAllister is All Grown Up

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NatickGames/natickgames.github.io/main/assets/05-24-Update/Warden.png" alt="Warden Calling">

The Warden is someone with an incredible connection to places that are important to them. Their magic takes form in bringing the peace and healing they get from their favorite places, or from places their loved ones are, to others around them in the form of Wards. Wards are magical areas that are permanent as long as allies within them don’t take too much damage, and offer beneficial effects at the end of each of the Warden’s turns. Wardens will fiercely defend their home and their loved ones, and so their Signature ability **Retributive Ward** functions halfway between a boon for allies and a trap for enemies.

Their first ability is **Healing Ward**. This does what you’d expect. It covers a small area around the target tile and heals allies inside at the end of each of the Warden’s turns. If allies inside it take too much damage, the ward is broken and goes on cooldown. If the player casts the ward again while it’s still active, they instead move the existing ward to the new location.

Their second ability is **Cleansing Ward**. This is similar to Healing Ward, except that it cleanses a negative condition at the end of each turn instead of healing. Similarly, casting again while active moves the existing ward.

Their signature is **Retributive Ward.**  This ward acts a bit differently. It has more health and covers a wider area. At the end of each of the Warden’s turns, it grants Fortified to allies inside (A defensive buff). When allies inside of it take damage, it loses health, as do the other wards, but it also saves up that lost health for when it breaks. When the ward breaks, it splits all of the damage it took between the enemies inside it’s area, dealing it back to them. For instance, if there are four enemies inside the ward when it breaks, and it took 200 damage, it will deal 50 damage to each. Instead of being able to move this ward with a subsequent cast, the Warden is able to cast it again to break the ward early, dealing whatever damage it had currently stored up. 

The Warden’s Passion passive gives their wards twice as much health. This can massively save them on action point costs, allowing hybrid characters to use their other abilities more frequently, but it also increases the maximum possible damage that the retributive ward can store and deal back.

The Warden’s Gift, increases their healing by healing allies for 10 whenever they have a condition on them end. (Whether it was cleansed or just timed out naturally.) The chip healing from this can really add up through a long session.

# The Fun Part - Character Design and Combos

So, lets create a few builds based on different character Archetypes, and see a small slice of the possibilities the calling system will offer. Using just these three classes and a few weapons, I want to create a Rogue, a Wizard, and a Condition inflicting Shaman.

## Rogue - Deadeye/Flameshaper

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NatickGames/natickgames.github.io/main/assets/05-24-Update/Rogue.png" alt="Rogue Deadeye/Flameshaper Build">

Let’s go with a magical rogue type character for the Deadeye and Flameshaper combo. 

We’re going to have Deadeye as our primary calling, meaning our ranged attacks will deal more damage at longer ranges, and Flameshaper as our secondary, making us immune to fire tiles.

In order to take advantage of the range damage bonus, we’ll take a bow as our primary weapon. We can hit targets that are 2-4 tiles away from us, and we have a secondary bow ability that pins enemies to the tile they’re on when we hit them. These both benefit from the range bonus, and keep our enemies at a distance for us. Our specials will be Fireball, again, for heavy ranged damage, and Triple Throw, letting us clean up weak targets at range with the flexible targeting. Finally, to take advantage of our fire immunity, our signature ability will be Firewall, so we can light the area around us on fire, again keeping enemies at range, which is right where we want them.

With this build, we’re going to be a heavy glass cannon that can devastate groups of enemies as long as we can keep them out of range of us. Which feels very much like the Magic Archer archetype we were trying to achieve.  

## Wizard - Flameshaper/Warden

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NatickGames/natickgames.github.io/main/assets/05-24-Update/Wizard.png" alt="Wizard Flameshaper/Warden Build">

For our wizard-type character, let’s pick the two magical classes we’ve talked about, Flameshaper and Warden. We’re going to have Flameshaper as our primary calling this time, letting our tile-targeted abilities set tiles on fire. That gives us the Warden as our secondary calling, so our allies will heal for 10 whenever a negative condition is removed or ends.

For our weapon, we’ll go with swords. The primary hand sword just does decent damage to every character on our tile, which can help us with a few of our other abilities. The secondary sword is a tile-targeted ability, so it will leave fire behind on our tile, and deal damage and bleed all targets on that tile as well. We can avoid the fire damage by making sure we can always move off of the tile after we use this ability. 

For our special abilities, this build could go either way between the Fireball or Flame Dash, but since we’re not immune to fire damage ourselves, I’m opting for Fireball so we can stay at range from all the fire tiles. If we were playing co-op and had another player who was giving us fire immunity, I might go for Flame Dash since it combos well with our weapons. For the other ability, let’s take Cleansing Ward. With our passive, the first turn we cast it, it’ll create a bunch of fire inside of it, so this positions it as a potential offensive ability as well as the defensive one it’s designed to be. In addition, once we get past that first turn and the fire dissipates, we can take advantage of our Warden passive by cleansing conditions on Allies, and gaining heals at the same time. This will let us restore some of that chip damage we’ll inevitably take from stepping in our fire from time to time. 

For our signature, we’ll take Retributive Ward, which should trigger very quickly since we’re lighting all the tiles inside of it on fire. That’s a massive fire spread at range, almost as big as Firewall would be if we just took it directly, and in addition, it’ll deal damage again once it explodes.

So here we’ve got a wizard-type character who is a heavily synergistic mix of ranged damage, area control, and even some support, protection, and healing built in. We might not have the 100 wizard spells you’d be accustomed to in a tabletop RPG, but we have great flexibility and multiple ways to take advantage of each of our abilities and passives.

## Shaman - Warden/Deadeye

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NatickGames/natickgames.github.io/main/assets/05-24-Update/Shaman.png" alt="Shaman Warden/Deadeye Build">

Finally, let’s create a Shaman out of Warden and Deadeye. We’ll take Warden as our primary, doubling our wards’ health, playing into that totem shaman style character. With our Deadeye gift, our AoE abilities won’t target friendlies, so we’ll want to make sure to take as many AoE abilities as we can with our remaining slots.

With that in mind, we’ll take the 2 Handed Hammer as our weapon package, and specifically pick the Guarded Slam as our secondary hand ability. Guarded slam is an AoE (taking advantage of our gift) that gives us a damage mitigation buff if we hit at least two enemies with it. Our primary ability is a single target strike that has a long enough reach to hit outside our own tile.

For our specials, we’ll make sure to take Fan of Knives so we have an AoE. Now we can inflict poisoned and deal damage to characters within a two tile radius, and we don’t need to worry about positioning ourselves to avoid allies. Since we’ll be up close and personal, let’s take Healing Ward as our first ward, playing into the shaman feel and giving us some sustainability for ourselves and any allies that stick near us. 

For our signature, we’ll take Retributive ward as well. We could take Heartseeker, as it’s probably one of the best standalone abilities in the game, but our ward is going to have double it’s health and we’re already planning to be controlling the battlefield in a close-range fight, protecting our nearby allies, so being able to protect them with the ward and deal twice as much damage when it breaks is too hard to pass up.

With this, we’ve taken a calling that usually lends itself to nimble, squishy rogues, and have been able to adapt it into a protective, tank/support shaman-type character. This might not be the most obvious way to build that kind of character, you might think of taking an element of some kind or something spiritual, but this definitely works and fits the theme. Beyond that, it seems like an effective frontline support-tank!

## Wrap Up

So there you go! These are just 3 of the 6 classes you’ll have available to you right at the start of the game, and 3 of 16 total that will be in the base game. Hopefully this gives you a small taste of the kind of build flexibility, and thematic flexibility that this callings and dual-classing system gives you as a player. I only really teased the opportunities you have as well between stat builds, weapon abilities, and we didn’t touch items at all. In the future, I’ll show some more piece by piece as the game comes along further. If this update has a good response, I’ll probably do this again with the other 3 starter classes, and create some classic Warrior/Rogue/Mage/Paladin/etc. archetype builds out of them.

This month I’ve actually been working a lot on the class unlock questlines and how those are going to work, and I’m pretty excited about how those are turning out, but I don’t want to spoil those really as I want players to experience those stories and those classes firsthand. That leaves me in a weird spot with what to write about next month, unless I can finish something that I’m willing to show during July. So if you have any ideas about what aspects of the game, it’s development, or anything else related you’d like to see more of, please reach out to me on Discord at @dekori or in whatever forum you found this post in. I’d love the feedback and it would be great to know I’m writing something that someone wants to hear about 🙂
