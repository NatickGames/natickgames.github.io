Hey internet people! This month I’ve some gameplay focused changes that came out of a playtest I did in early March. I spent most of March and April working through the feedback and and lessons learned form that playtest, and this month I want to highlight some of the core gameplay improvements that have come from that. 

There’s two sets of changes I want to talk about in this update, the new director for event participation and rewards, and a redesign of some of the information sharing in the game to complement the more Co-op focused direction the game has been taking during playtests.

## Event Participation and Rewards

[Last month](https://natickgames.github.io/2024/04/06/march-2024-update.html) I talked about questlines, which serve as your character’s sort of meta-goal and feed into account wide progression. Events serve as more session specific and moment to moment style content and goals. Events can be anything from a prison transfer caravan making its way across the map, to a strange elemental occurrence happening in some ruins, or a peacemaker from an enemy faction that you have the chance to negotiate with. The types of things an RPG would create sidequests or set pieces out of, are handled through the event system, which fills each map with activity before you arrive there. 

In taking this approach, rather than traditional side quests, I had to determine how I could know when to reward players for something notable they’ve done or when they’ve altered the status quo on the map they’re on. The answer I came up with is the Event Participation Director.

Essentially the director is a system that tracks player impact and involvement in each active event on the map, and when the event completes, it uses that impact evaluation to reward the players appropriately. This gives a lot of flexibility for players as to what they can get rewarded by. For a simple example, lets take that NPC negotiation event. The director will watch the event play out, and if by the end of it the players have attempted to negotiate with the NPC, it will track that, as well as how successful they were. If the event succeeds, players will be rewarded based on how influential the party was in that success (meaning, they didn’t just walk up as it was ending or sit back and let NPC characters resolve the whole thing). A success will mean a full reward for the party’s impact, and if the event fails, players will still receive a (reduced) reward if it’s clear they were trying to help the event succeed. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NatickGames/natickgames.github.io/main/assets/04-24-Update/EventFailureReward.png" alt="Even a failed event will reward you for your efforts... a little">

What does event success or failure mean in a more complex event though? Valantis is a game that allows your relationships with other factions to be fluid. One party might be allies to the town guards and enemies of the rebels in the woods, but another party might have the opposite allegiances. This is where the flexibility of the Event Director shines. The director keeps track of what faction the players are trying to help. So at the end of the event, for the sake of rewards the event will be considered “successful” or “failed” depending on which faction the players were supporting. Those rebel players will be rewarded for a successful prisoner transfer event if they free their rebel comrade from the guard caravan and rough up the guards, but Valantian military-friendly parties will see that same outcome as a failure, and a successful transfer to the prison will be their goal.

The hope with this system is to continue the focus on rewarding player and party roleplaying. In testing, its looked clear that the only way to really have your playstyle and efforts be unrewarded by the director at this point is when your party are disunified and all pulling for different outcomes for the same event. Which leads to the next topic…

## Co-op Redesign & Party UI

Early on, Valantis was heavily inspired by board games like *Betrayal at House on Hill* and *Gloomhaven*. (Fantastic games by the way, go play them.) Betrayal, in particular, inspired me initially, especially during the 2020-2021 *Among Us* era of social deduction games. Due to that inspiration, I originally wanted to have you load into a portion of the city of Valantis with your party, not sure what everyone’s real goal for being there was, until halfway through the game, everyone found out their secret win conditions and either completed them together or tried to sneakily outplay their former party members. I still love this, and I might pay a little homage to that idea in a side mission or an event chain or two here or there, but as I’ve been building the game these last few years I’ve largely moved away from that, as the adventuring side by side with your friends and combining your specialties with each other has really been a big core of the fun of the game. Not to mention the move to supporting single player has meant that the core of the game can’t really rely on social deduction.

With that being said, many of the core systems were still programmed and designed back when this was more of a co-operative/competitive game and less of a solo/co-op adventure. When I sat down for that playtest with a few players in a party, we all quickly realized that we were fighting the game a bit to act like a party, rather than the systems guiding us to play as a team. So in the last month I’ve been going through the systems in the game and smoothing out some of those edges around co-op play. 

### Sharing Fog of War

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NatickGames/natickgames.github.io/main/assets/04-24-Update/SharedVision.png" alt="See what your friends are doing from a mile away">

The first change was pretty obvious to make. Before, you could see the other players when they were outside your vision range, but you couldn’t see anything around them. This made it hard to support allies, exceptionally difficult to talk and reason about that clump of enemies your friend could see but was right outside your vision range, and made other player’s turns pretty dull. 

So, now, all players can see the tiles that are inside of any player’s vision range. I didn’t remove the code that hid those tiles from other players, so it could still come back in the form of a status condition or event effect or something, but now the default is that you can all see and communicate about whatever any of you can see.

### Party Member UI

At the bottom of the UI, I’ve added small HUDs for each member of your party, so you can easily see their health, status conditions, etc. This makes support gameplay or just being a team player a lot easier, especially since in general you don’t get to see detailed health information for other characters. Though the game is shifting to a more co-op focus, many abilities do still have the possibility of friendly fire( as a roleplaying aid and a way to add some depth to combat encounters). Having more detailed information about your party members statuses can help you with the risk/reward calculation of launching that fireball on your friend.

### Turn Timers

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NatickGames/natickgames.github.io/main/assets/04-24-Update/TurnTimer.png" alt="Better hurry. Turn timers keep the game moving.">

Finally, there’s a new gameplay setting that can be set up in the game lobby for adding turn timers for player turns. By default, this is active and set to 90 seconds. The goal with this is to keep games moving and push players towards the intended goal of roleplaying more than min/maxing each move. Many other aspects of the design, like the AI design, not showing specific health numbers for characters, the fluid nature of enemy/neutral/ally relationships, etc, support this. However there’s still a lot of muscle memory from playing Tactics games that moves you into slow, deliberate mode when you see turn based grid movement and combat. 

If you and your party want to take it slow or be methodical, the party leader can deactivate or reactivate the timer setting at any time in game. You can also turn the feature off or change the turn duration in the lobby before the game. But as a default option, this has been moving the gameplay experience in the direction we’ve been hoping for.

### Other

There have been some other, smaller changes made to support co-op, like sharing kill credit on kill quest steps in questlines, among others. In addition, it hasn’t been done yet, but once some of the necessary tech is in place, I’ll also be making it so you can watch and follow along with conversations and dialogues other players have with NPCs. Dialogue is one of the places where the turn based nature of the game has slowed things down the most, and previously you couldn’t see what your friend was talking about, so you just sort of sat there while they talked. That’s no fun, and it has the potential to push players towards ignoring talking to NPCs to save time, which is the exact opposite of what we’re trying to do. So sharing a view of all conversations, combined with the turn timers, should go a long way to improving that experience.

## Wrap Up

Overall, I think these changes have drastically improved the moment to moment gameplay in the last month or so, and I’m excited to get them into the hands of my playtest group and see how they improve the experience. 

Next month, I have a couple possible topics that I might share a bit about. I’m currently working on some automated testing tech which I might have something to show, or I may give a look into the process of creating a class unlock questline. Not sure if I want to go with a more tech heavy or design heavy update, but it’ll likely depend on the status of those two projects at the end of the month and which one is more ready to show.
