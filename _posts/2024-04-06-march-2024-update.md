Hey internet people! March has been a crazy month around here. In the middle of the month we welcomed our new baby into the world üë∂üèª. We‚Äôre so excited that our little guy is here happy and healthy, and everyone is doing well (but tired of course). 

Before the baby came, I was able to wrap up the fundamentals of the quest system, and since then I‚Äôve squeezed in a few bug fixes here and there. This will be a short update, but I wanted to provide one either way.

## Questlines

In February and March, most of my development time was spent getting the questline system up and running. Characters in Valantis are permadeath characters, and they each have a defined goal in the form of a questline. When you create a character, you‚Äôll select their 2 classes, abilities, stats, and appearance, but you‚Äôll make a decision about their questline right up front. Questlines anchor a character with a goal and provide a new Calling (character class), weapon, or some appearance options as a reward for completing them successfuly. Each of the Calling unlock questlines will be handcrafted to anchor your new calling in the world and give you a sense of the story behind each of them.

In an individual session in Valantis, you‚Äôll attempt to complete the next step or two of your character‚Äôs questline while keeping them alive, and getting out before things [escalate](https://natickgames.github.io/2024/02/29/february-2024-update.html) too far. At any given time, your questline will have one or more next steps available to be done, so you can adapt your goals in a session to what you come across on that particular map.

At the very end of the questline, there will be a final challenge that serves as the culmination of the quest and the way you get your reward. 

At this point, I know that the questlines for each of the Calling unlocks will be handcrafted, but I might proceduralize the weapon and appearance option questlines. On character creation you are presented with options of which (unfinished) questline to give to this character, and at least one of those options will always be a calling unlock questline if you don‚Äôt have them all unlocked yet.

Hopefully, this gives you an idea of what the driving progression loop for the game will be, unlocking new character options and customization through questlines on various short-ish-lived characters. 

## Passions and Gifts

The other system I‚Äôve been working on this month (not completed yet) is the passion and gift system. These are passive abilities tied to each calling; one of each type per calling. The goal with these is to add some progression to callings that you already have unlocked, and create opportunities for side objectives that can add some depth and lore to the various classes. Ultimately though, I want the passives to feel impactful and change how you build your characters as you unlock more of them.

To fit in with the dual class system in the game, each class has two passive abilities to unlock, a ‚ÄúPassion‚Äù, which you get on characters with the calling as their primary calling, and a ‚ÄúGift‚Äù, which is for characters with the calling as their secondary calling. This means that on a single character, you can never have both of the passives for the same calling, but with teamwork between players you could cover them both. Let‚Äôs look at the Flameshaper class as an example of what these passives can do:

### Flameshaper: Passion

Description: Your abilities that target *Tiles* leave fire behind for 1 turn.

Passion effects are usually more self-focused and offensive based effects that allow the class to do whatever they‚Äôre trying to do more efficiently. In this case, Flameshapers are about area damage and controlling the battlefield through area denial. Leaving fire tiles behind on everything they hit adds damage potential and zoning ability, exactly what the Flameshaper is looking for. However, this also accentuates their risk of self or friendly damage, as fire damage doesn‚Äôt discriminate between friend or foe. 

Abilities like this open up calling combo opportunities, as the fire is added to any ability that targets tiles rather than characters. So you could pick Flameshaper as your primary calling, and then look for large AoE tile based effects to create as much fire damage as possible, even on abilities from other classes that didn‚Äôt deal damage before.

### Flameshaper: Gift

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NatickGames/natickgames.github.io/main/assets/03-24-Update/FlameshaperGiftUI.png" alt="Flameshaper Gift on the Character Creation UI">

Description: Allies are immune to damage from fire tiles.

The Gift effects are the other side of the coin. As the secondary calling in your build, gifts tend to focus on supporting your allies in one way or another. For the Flameshaper, this means protecting your allies from fire tile damage. The base Flameshaper ability kit has an ability that spreads fire tiles over a wide area, and so you can take that ability without fear if you‚Äôre a Gift Flameshaper. In additon, this serves as a defensive tool for your team against enemy Flameshapers who use that ability. 

What probably immediately jumps out is the synergy between these two passives, but you can‚Äôt get both on a single character. If you wanted to build a team around this idea though, you could get another player to play Passion Flameshaper, and they could lay down large areas of fire while you protect the team from the effects. Just‚Ä¶ be careful about any neutral NPCs in the area or they‚Äôre not going to be neutral (or alive) for long.

(This is fine.)

Hopefully that gives you an idea of the depth and variety that calling passives can add to buildcraft and gameplay. These passive abilities will not be available immediately, but will instead be unlocked by seeking out rumors and legends about how others of your callings have enhanced their abilities over the years. This adds a lot of replayability to the callings. Your first playthrough you‚Äôll just have their base abilities and maybe will unlock a passive for your next character, and then as your collection of callings and passives grow, your ability to experiment with unique playstyles will grow with it. I can‚Äôt wait to see what players come up with when they start experimenting with these different callings and passive effects.

## Wrap Up

So that‚Äôs it for March, most of the work here has been on creating goals and build diversity for characters through these two systems. Currently, I‚Äôm working on some bug fixes and small redesigns of behind the scenes systems, but in April, I should have some progress to share on a recent playtest and how the feedback has helped re-shape how players share information and goals together. 

Until then, thanks for taking the time to dive into these new Valantis features, and feel free to drop by the Valantis channels on the Tarodev and FishNetworking discords and chat.
